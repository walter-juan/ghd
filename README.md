# Installation

## Windows application

Download the `exe` file from [releases](https://github.com/walter-juan/ghd/releases/latest) and install.

## macOS application

The **macOS application is unsigned** and to be able to run the `com.apple.quarantine` has to be removed. Right now, as this app is more for personal use, I don't want to register and do all the stuff about signing with Apple.

> The `com.apple.quarantine` attribute is used to determine if an application should be checked (and blocked if needed.)

So if you want to use this app you should remove the `com.apple.quarantine`.

**How to install**

1. Download the `dmg` file from [releases](https://github.com/walter-juan/ghd/releases/latest)
2. Open the `dmg` file and move the application to `Applications` folder
3. Open terminal and run:
  ```shell
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ghd.app
  ```

# Database

The database used in this project is [H2](https://www.h2database.com/) because of encryption support + embedded. As the database is encrypted a user and password is required, you can find it in [DbSettings](app/src/main/kotlin/com/woowla/ghd/data/local/db/DbSettings.kt).

**H2 Commands**

- [`SCRIPT`](https://www.h2database.com/html/commands.html#script): Creates a SQL script from the database.

**H2 Console**

For more detailed information follow [the tutorial from H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/tutorial.html).

1. Download H2 console app:
   - The `Platform-Independent Zip` from [the website](https://www.h2database.com/html/download.html)
   - Or `h2-<version>.jar` from [the GitHub releases](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/releases)
2. From terminal run the h2 `$ java -jar h2*.jar` and the web browser will be opened.
