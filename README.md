# Installation

## Windows application

Download the `exe` file from [releases](https://github.com/walter-juan/ghd/releases/latest) and install.

## macOS application

The **macOS application is unsigned** and to be able to run the `com.apple.quarantine` has to be removed. Right now, as this app is more for personal use, I don't want to register and do all the stuff about signing with Apple.

> The `com.apple.quarantine` attribute is used to determine if an application should be checked (and blocked if needed.)

So if you want to use this app you should remove the `com.apple.quarantine`.

**How to install**

1. Download the `dmg` file from [releases](https://github.com/walter-juan/ghd/releases/latest)
2. Open the `dmg` file and move the application to `Applications` folder
3. Open terminal and run:
  ```shell
  xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ghd.app
  ```

  ```

- Remove the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute recursively for the entire targeted .app directory contents
  ```shell
  sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/my-app.app
  ```

- Remove the all attributes + recursively
  ```shell
  sudo xattr -cr /path/to/my-app.app

# Useful Gradle commands

**By default, the debug flag is enabled**, example how to remove it:
```shell
$ ./gradlew build -PdebugConfig=false
```

- Run the app
    ```shell
    ./gradlew run
    ```
- Build the project
    ```shell
    ./gradlew build
    ```
- Clean the project
    ```shell
    ./gradlew clean
    ```
- Clean the debug app folder
    ```shell
    ./gradlew ghdCleanDebugAppFolder
    ```
- Create the packages
    ```shell
    ./gradlew packageDistributionForCurrentOS
    ```
- To know which dependencies have updates, you can use `openBrowser` to open directly the browser with the HTML report:
    ```shell
    ./gradlew dependencyUpdates
    ./gradlew dependencyUpdates -PopenBrowser=true
    ```
- Update Gradle version
    ```shell
    ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version latest
    ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 7.5.1
    ```
